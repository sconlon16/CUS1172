  <div class="sectionwhite" id="Education summary" >
    <h2 class="section"> Education </h2>
    <p> My education is composed of information technology as well as
     computer science. I graduated in 2016 from high school and began
     college at <span style="color:red">St. Johnâ€™s University</span>
     the following fall. I went into the field of technology after
     beginning a job on campus as a technician for our Information
     Technology department. Before I was able to take apart the
     machines, I had to take the certification exam for apple
     technicians so each machine would still be under warranty after
     I had replaced their part. The rest of my programming knowledge
     comes from codeacademy as well as other online sources of
     learning coding languages. </p>

      <div class="coding-language">
        <h3 class="subtitle">Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first
        released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications
        and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed,
        and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.
        From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific
        supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="coding-language">
        <h3 class="subtitle">MySQL</h3>
        <p>MySQL Server was originally developed to handle large databases
          much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used
          in highly demanding production environments for several years.
          Although under constant development, MySQL Server today offers a
          rich and useful set of functions. Its connectivity, speed, and
          security make MySQL Server highly suited for accessing databases
          on the Internet.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="coding-language">
        <h3 class="subtitle">HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation.
        These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the
        Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being
        accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in
        what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision
        and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing
        Internet audience under the direction of the W3C, the organisation
        charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="coding-language">
        <h3 class="subtitle"> Python</h3>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
         language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
         structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make
         it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well
         as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
         components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
         readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. </p>
